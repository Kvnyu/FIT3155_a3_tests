## Testing helpers for Assignment 3 Question 2
 - The testing code is located in `test.py`
 - You'll need to change the path of the `myunzip_path` and `myzip_path` in `test.py` 
 - To add test files, add them to the `/original` directory
 - To exclude files, add them to the `exclude` variable at the bottom of `test.py`
 - Feel free to make a PR to add tests!
