## Testing helpers for Assignment 3
 - Tests are located in `test.py` in /task1 and task2 respectively
 - You'll need to change the path of the `myunzip_path` and `myzip_path` in `test.py` 
 - To add test files, add them to the `/original` directory
 - To exclude files, add them to the `exclude` variable at the bottom of `test.py`
 - Also you might wanna delete the files in `/decoded` and `/encoded` before you run the test
 - Feel free to make a PR to add tests!
